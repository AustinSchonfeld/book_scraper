# Portfolio Project: Book Scraper
A web scraper that collects book titles and prices.

This scraper sorts through each category of a fake book store. In each category it pulls the title, price, and category of all the books. Then the lists of every category are compiled together to create a single dataframe.

From that dataframe three graphs are created in addition to exporting the data to csv format.
1) A histogram of book prices
2) A bar chart of the number of books per category
3) A histogram of the number of characters in each book title
